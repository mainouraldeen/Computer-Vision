# Computer-Vision
Computer Vision course's competition - 2020.

The goal of the competition is to build deep learning models that can recognize the action of the video.

Action recognition task involves the identification of different actions from video clips (a sequence of 2D frames) where the action may or may not be performed throughout the entire duration of the video. This seems like a natural extension of image classification tasks to multiple frames and then aggregating the predictions from each frame.

# Dataset description
UCF is an action recognition data set of realistic action videos, collected from YouTube. The dataset contains 5 categories (Basketball, Diving, Jumping, Tennis, and Walking). The training set contains 5 folders, around 100 video for each vategory. The testing set contains 126 vidoos. The goal is to build a model than can recognize the cateogry of each video in the testing set.
